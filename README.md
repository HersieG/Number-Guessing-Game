# Number Guessing Game
### How To Play
When you load up this website, there is going to be content box in the middle of the screen advising the user the name of the game, some simple instructions, and a text field where you can guess the number, which is only from ranger 1-10.

### Lessons learned
In the creation of this project, I familiarized myself with basic html and css concepts, along with learning how to use javascript to give a webpage certain functionality. I have added a pop up section that appears when a user guessed the wrong number, when the user typed a number outside of the range of 1-10, and also when the user got the guess right. When the user guessing the number correctly, a "Play Again" button appears, prompting the user to play again.
